# DeepGroundwater

## Promoting research through blog posts and open-source code 

DeepGroundwater was inspired from the idea that not all research belongs on academic journals. There is great work done by students, postdocs, and research leads that may not advance the science, but deserves to be shared with the community. Furthermore, the peer-review process often can take weeks, if not months, for a paper to make it from draft to published. There is a need for a site to share developing reserach, and code, with others to spurn discovery and novelty; and we at Deep Groundwater hope we can provide that here.
